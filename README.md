# JMH-hashmap

Made for the class: **CSC 375 - Parallel Programing**

In this project I focused on building and testing a concurrent java hashmap. My hashmap was benchmarked with JMH and tested against the JDK concurrent hashmap. I Tested the throughput of large numbers of operations with both hashmaps and found that in most scenarios, my hashmap was faster.
